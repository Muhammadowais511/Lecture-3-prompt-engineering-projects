# Prompt Engineering Portfolio
https://github.com/Muhammadowais511/Lecture-3-prompt-engineering-projects/blob/main/Prompt%20engineering%20Project/Prompt%20engineering%20presentation.pptx

This repository showcases my basic skills in prompt engineering. It includes structured prompts, their outputs, examples of prompt refinement, and the effect of model settings like temperature, top-p, and penalties.

## Contents:
- 5 sample prompts and outputs
- Explanation of prompt types
- Prompt refinement examples
- Use of temperature, top-p, and penalties

## Purpose:
To demonstrate my ability to write effective prompts and adjust AI model behavior to generate desired results.

## Usage:
This portfolio can be used as part of a job application, course project, or freelancing profile to demonstrate foundational prompt engineering skills.
