# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases my basic skills in prompt engineering. It includes structured prompts, their outputs, examples of prompt refinement, and the effect of model settings like temperature, top-p, and penalties.

## Contents:
- 5 sample prompts and outputs
- Explanation of prompt types
- Prompt refinement examples
- Use of temperature, top-p, and penalties

## Purpose:
To demonstrate my ability to write effective prompts and adjust AI model behavior to generate desired results.

## Usage:
This portfolio can be used as part of a job application, course project, or freelancing profile to demonstrate foundational prompt engineering skills.
